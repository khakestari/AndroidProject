# Kotlin Android Project
This is a Kotlin Android project developed as part of an Android development course at university. The project showcases the basic structure and functionalities of an Android application, including fetching and displaying data from a remote API, using Room for local database storage, and implementing a simple UI.

## Introduction
This project is my first attempt at developing an Android application using Kotlin. Having experience with the Flutter framework, this project helped me understand the differences and unique aspects of Android development with Kotlin.

- Fetches movie data from a remote API
- Displays movie details in a RecyclerView
